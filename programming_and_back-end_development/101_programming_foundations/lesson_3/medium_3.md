### Exercises: Medium 3

##### Question 1

** Every named entity in Ruby has an `object_id`. This is a unique identifier for that object. **

** It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable. **

** In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME object. **

** Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below: **

```
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block.\n\n"

  1.times do
    a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
    b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
    c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
    d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

    puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the block and is: #{a_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the block and is: #{b_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the block and is: #{c_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the block and is: #{d_outer_inner_id} inside the block.\n\n"

# The same object id's as the ones before the block. All outer_inner's are pointing to the same objects outer's are pointing to.

    a_outer = 22
    b_outer = "thirty three"
    c_outer = [44]
    d_outer = c_outer[0]

    puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after.\n\n"

# These have different object id's since the variables have been reassigned and are pointing to completely different objects.

    a_inner = a_outer
    b_inner = b_outer
    c_inner = c_outer
    d_inner = c_inner[0]

    a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
    b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
    c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
    d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

    puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer).\n\n"
  end
  
# The same object id's as the previous puts statements. 

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the block.\n\n"
  
# The same object id's as the previous puts statement

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the block.\n\n" rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
end
```
# Will output "ugh ohhhh" since variables are out of scope from outside the block

##### Question 2

** Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call instead of a block. **

** Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the block/method. We simply took the contents of the block from the previous exercise and moved it to a method, to which we are passing all of our outer variables. **

** Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below: **

```
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block.\n\n"

  an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)


  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the method call.\n\n"
  
# Will output the same object id's as the first four calls to puts

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the method." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the method.\n\n" rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
end

# Variables are out of scope and will therefore return "ugh ohhhhh"

def an_illustrative_method(a_outer, b_outer, c_outer, d_outer, a_outer_id, b_outer_id, c_outer_id, d_outer_id)
  a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the method and is: #{a_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the method and is: #{b_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the method and is: #{c_outer.object_id} inside the method."
  puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the method and is: #{d_outer.object_id} inside the method.\n\n"

# Will puts the same object id's before entering the method

  a_outer = 22
  b_outer = "thirty three"
  c_outer = [44]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
  puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after.\n\n"

# Variables assigned to different objects and will thus have different object id's

  a_inner = a_outer
  b_inner = b_outer
  c_inner = c_outer
  d_inner = c_inner[0]

  a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
  b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
  c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
  d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the method (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer).\n\n"
end

# The same object id's as outer's

##### Question 3
** Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different. **

** Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why: **

```
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```
___
`my_string` will remain as "pumpkins". `my_string` was passed in as an argument to the method. A reassignment, however, was done with `a_string_param += "rutabaga"` which doesn't affect the variable `my_string`.

The array is changed. Specifically, "rutabaga" was appended to the array. Thus, `my_array` is now `["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]`.
##### Question 4
** To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it. **

```
def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param.gsub!('pumpkins', 'rutabaga')
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```
___
By using a bang method like gsub!, arguments passed in are mutated. In this case, "pumpkins" is now "rutabaga".

`my_array`, on the other hand, remains unchanged as `an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']` is merely a reassignment.
##### Question 5
** How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed? **

```
def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
```
___
```
def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end
```
